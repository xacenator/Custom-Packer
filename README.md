Custom generic packer:

Drag and drop exe you want to protect into packer.exe. Will create a new exe with a "- protected" enxtension to the name.
Take a look at the differences in IDAs likew Ghidra and IdaPro. You will see Control Flow Flattening and encrypted strings and Functions. 

Designed to make reversing your .exe harder against malicious attempts. 

Open Source, Feel free to edit and use. I have used Chat GPT for this as well, so keep in mind that there will be error. 

Not finished yet. There are some issues with the Memory Relocation of the newly created executable that I am currently fixing. 

Thanks for checking my code out!
